# How-to Guide:

> Note: I used Visual Studio 2017 with .NET Framework 4.8 to compile it. The plugin was tested on Outlook 2019.
> Also, verify that you have "Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects" component installed in Visual Studio. You can install it by going to "Tools" -> "Get Tools and Features"

1. Download the project and extract it.
2. Double click "PhishingReporter.sln" to open the project using Visual Studio.
3. From the top menu, if it is on "Debug" mode, change configuration to "Release".
4. In the right menu, Open "Settings.settings" and go to "Settings" Tab.
5. From there, change:
	- infosec_email: to your information security team.
	- gophish_url: GoPhish instance IP/URL, if you didn't host any, you can leave the default value. The plugin will still work.
	- gophish_listener_port: The port number of GoPhish listener.
	- support_email: Support email to auto-report any bugs. Should be for a teammate who maintains the plugin code.
6. Save the file.
7. Build the project. From the top menu "Build" â†’ "Build PhishingReporter".
8. In the right menu, Click "Installer" and change what you prefer on "Properties" Menu, I recommend to change:
	- Manufacturer, ManufacturerUrl, SupportPhone, SupportUrl
	- Generate a new UpgradeCode by clicking the "..." button then "New Code".
9. [Optional] If you want to change the installation wizard splash screen:
	- Open "splash.psd" file using Photoshop, and design the splash screen you like.
	- Export the design by overwriting "splash.jpg" file in the main project directory.
10. At the end, right-click "Installer" and choose "Build".
11. The installer file should be located in "PhishingReporter\Installer\Release" folder.
