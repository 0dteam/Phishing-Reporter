# Before you start:

:warning: Verify that you have `Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects` component installed in Visual Studio. You can install it by going to `Tools` -> `Get Tools and Features`

:warning: Make sure you build the project's installer with the right TargetPlatform for your Office. If you have Office 32-bit installed, then compile the project as 32-bit. If you have Office 64-bit, then compile the project as 64-bit. You can do so by choosing `Installer -> (from "Properties" menu) TargetPlatform -> x86 or x64`

# How-to Guide:

> Note: I used Visual Studio 2017 with .NET Framework 4.8 to compile it. The plugin was tested on Outlook 2019 (x64).
1. Download the project and extract it.
2. Double click `PhishingReporter.sln` to open the project using Visual Studio.
3. From the top menu, if it is on `Debug` mode, change configuration to `Release`.
4. In the right menu, Open `Settings.settings` and go to `Settings` Tab.
5. From there, change:
	- infosec_email: to your information security team.
	- gophish_url: GoPhish instance IP/URL, if you didn't host any, you can leave the default value. The plugin will still work.
	- gophish_listener_port: The port number of GoPhish listener.
	- support_email: Support email to auto-report any bugs. Should be for a teammate who maintains the plugin code.
6. Save the file.
7. Build the project. From the top menu `Build` â†’ `Build PhishingReporter`.
8. In the right menu, Click `Installer` and change what you prefer on `Properties` Menu, I recommend to change:
	- Manufacturer, ManufacturerUrl, SupportPhone, SupportUrl
	- Generate a new UpgradeCode by clicking the `...` button then `New Code`.
9. [Optional] If you want to change the installation wizard splash screen:
	- Open `splash.psd` file using Photoshop, and design the splash screen you like.
	- Export the design by overwriting `splash.jpg` file in the main project directory.
10. At the end, right-click `Installer` and choose `Build`.
11. The installer file should be located in `PhishingReporter\Installer\Release` folder.


# Integration with GoPhish:
